        <p>
          Cutting ones hair is a meaningful form of protest.
          In the history of Iran, when women didn’t have enough power to stand up, they cut their hair,” the journalist continues. It has always been a symbol of rebellion and to start a fight.

        </a>
        <p>
          Women have led mass protests in Iran for more than eight weeks now. From school-aged to university, young women in Iran are rebelling against the suppression and humiliation their mothers have endured over the past 43 years. Iranian women have played a major role in demonstrations since the 1979 revolution.

            An Iranian athlete competed without a hijab during a climbing competition in South Korea on Sunday, and now her future — and safety — are uncertain.
            The controversy over Elnaz Rekabi not wearing the mandatory head covering comes amid ongoing protests in Iran after Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian woman, died in police custody after allegedly breaking hijab rules, according to the Deseret News.

            About 80,000 Iranians and their supporters have marched in Berlin, German police say, in solidarity with ongoing protests in Iran.
            Saturday's rally in the German capital is believed to have been the biggest so far held by the Iranian diaspora.
            Iranians from across Europe chanted the slogan of the protesters "Women, Life and Liberty!"
